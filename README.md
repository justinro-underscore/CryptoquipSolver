# Cryptoquip Solver

## How to run:

Download the *__CryptoquipSolver.jar__* from this page. Then simply double click
the .jar to run the application.

## What is this program?

I like the Cryptoquips in the University Daily Kansas, but there's a problem -
it's a pain to constantly be guessing something, then erasing it when it turns
out to be the wrong letter. In order to fix that, I created the
**Cryptoquip Solver**! With this program, I can easily try new combinations
of letters to solve the code!

## What's a Cryptoquip?

The rules are simple: you are given an encoded message, and you must decode it.
In order to do this, you simply map a letter to another letter. It's a little
more complicated than a Caeser Cipher, as each letter can be any other letter,
but there are no overlaps. The game is a fun challenge, and can be more or less
difficult depending on the words chosen.

## How does the solver work?

When first starting the Cryptoquip Solver, a new game window will pop up. Simply
copy down the code into the text area and hit *Submit*. You will then be sent
to the main page.

Once here, you can put in text in the text field adjacent to the code. When you
input a letter, it will automatically update the translation below the code! It's
that simple!

## What's next for the Cryptoquip Solver?

Not much, honestly. The only things that I think could be added are:

- A timer to see how fast you can solve the code
- A save feature that will allow you to load and save old and new codes

This was just a fun little project that I worked on on a lazy Sunday morning.
Maybe I'll come back to it! (Probably not though...)
